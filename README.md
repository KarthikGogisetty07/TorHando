# TorHando
#### The Project TorHando is an Idea to make an Autonomous mobile Robot which has the
capabilities of self-Navigation and ability to work in an environments where humans inter￾actions are minimal. Our objective is to make sure this project is a start to an ambiguous
 dream of true automation.
 We will be using the existing Turtle Bot along side other attributes to achieve two Im￾portant objectives -
### Go To Goal :
#### To have ability to Navigate in the Local Geography and reach the Pro￾jected target Location.
### Addition of Manipulator : 
#### Ability to Manipulate and utilise an Manipulator to per￾form required tasks.
##### The Primary objective is to reach level two autonomy using existing hardware and later
 develop with the results we gained and improve up to level four autonomy theoretically.
