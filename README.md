# TorHando
#### The Project TorHando is an Idea to make an Autonomous mobile Robot which has the capabilities of self-Navigation and ability to work in an environments where humans interactions are minimal. Our objective is to make sure this project is a start to an ambiguous dream of true automation. We will be using the existing Turtle Bot along side other attributes to achieve two Important objectives -
### Go To Goal :
#### To have ability to Navigate in the Local Geography and reach the Projected target Location.
### Addition of Manipulator : 
#### Ability to Manipulate and utilise an Manipulator to perform required tasks.
##### The Primary objective is to reach level two autonomy using existing hardware and later develop with the results we gained and improve up to level four autonomy theoretically. 

### Abstract 
##### Torhando is an Autonomous Mobile & Manipulating
Robot that is capable of Level 2 Autonomy in end effector
manipulation and Both Level 2 and Level 4 Autonomy in
Mobility. its primary Hardware consists of Turtlebot 2 and a
robotic Arm and a Gripper. By programming it with ROS the
Bot is capable of Mapping the surrounding using the Kinect
Camera and plan its path. It can avoid obstacles in a set path after Mapping of
the surroundings. The simulations of the bot are obtained in both
Gazebo and Blender. With the help of BotFather an Open-Source
Platform to create custom chat-bots. We are able to Operate the
end effector. Which is a gripper, by sending Instructions from a
mobile phone and operated on a Rpi4. The Torhando is still in 
its prototype stage with a lot of room to improve and adapt.
