## Test Phase of End Effector with Uno 

##### Before trying in the proper assembly of manipulator with Raspberry Pi, a test phase is performed with Arduino Uno to open and close the end effector continously.

#### Materials Used:

* Servo
* Servo Mount
* Gripper Links
* Shafts
* Gears (A,B)

#### Code Explanation

##### First we imported the requried libraries
```
#include <Servo.h>
```

##### Create an object of the servo that we use to manipulate the the end-effector, atmost twelve servo objects can be created on most boards.
```
Servo myservo;
```

##### Now let us create a variable to store the servo position in it.
```
int pos = 0;
```

##### Now initialise the setups that are requried, that is attaching the servo on pin-9 to the servo object thats is created.
```
void setup() {
  myservo.attach(9);  
}
```

##### Now we came up with a logic to move servo from 0 degrees to 90 degrees and back to home position. The function myservo.write() tells the servo to go to the position of the variable 'pos' and then give a delay for any desirable amount of time. 
```
void loop() {
  for (pos = 0; pos <= 90; pos += 1) {
    // in steps of 1 degree
    myservo.write(pos);              
    delay(15);                       
   }
  for (pos = 90; pos >= 0; pos -= 1) { 
    myservo.write(pos);             
    delay(15);                       
  }
}
```

#### Conclusion: 

##### The logic helped rotate the gear A and there by rotating gear B in opposite direction to open and close the gripper. Which helps release the tennis ball that it holds in the beginning of the task. Similar logic can be replicated in RPi to get the desired output when the input is sent via message in a chat-bot.

##### As we can see the driver and driven gears are moving in opposite direction. In our model as we kept the number of teeth same in both driver (A) and driven gear (B) the speed generated by gear A on B is same, Hence produces a uniform open and close mechanism to release the ball.
