# Gripper Construction

A gripper is a device that enables the robot to pick and 
hold an object to be manipulated.We are able to use gripper for 
multiple purposes such as inspection , assembly , pick and place
and machine tending.

Here we are designing a gripper for pick and place and object 
that is attached to the manipulator using fusion 360.


## Parts to be created 
We  have to make different parts and assembly then together 
to complete the gripper as a whole.

Necessary parts:-

1. Link 1 & 2:
 This link is the main body of the gripper that 
grabs the object which we want and it is a symmetrical body .
Refer to Pic 1.

2. Revet Type 1:
 This type of revet is used to connect the spur gear,link 1 and the servo motor shaft.
 Refer to Pic 2.

3. Revet Type 2:
 Revet that connect only the second spur gear and the second link.
Refer to pic 3.

4. Spur Gear:
 Spur gear used in our project where two similar gears are attached to link 1 and link 2 
 respectively.The gears are in a mesh .Refer to pic 4.

5. Base body:
It is build level the spur gear that we are trying mesh and this 
base is attached on top of the servo motor.Refer to pic 5.

6. Gripper Manipulator connector:
We need some sort of mechanism to connect the gripper to the manipulator.Refer to pic 6.

7. Gripper Manipulator Screw:
 To fix the gripper to the manipulator we are using screws.Refer to pic 7.

8. Servo Motor:
Another important part is the servo motor for the gripper to function properly.
Refer to pic 8.

## Assembly
Here we cearted all the parts using 3D printer.

The process to covert fusion 360 model :
 To 3D print each models we have to export file as ".sml" and save in your local space.
 After that open fracktory software and open the sml file and prepare where it will show the time it will take to 
 print that specific material . We can also change infill of the maaterial(filament,here we used FLA) that we are using to print ,customize the temperature of the bed and nozzle of the printer and many other options.
 After preparing it will save as a gcode file in your local space.We can use to methods to sent gcode file to printer.
 One it is via USB and second is by typing the ip address of the print in a browser.Finally wee are able to print.


Hence, when all parts are downloaded we can assemble them together.Refer to pic 9.

## Result and Final Process
Here we were able to complete the 3D print all parts and perform a sucessful pick and hold function.
